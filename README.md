# NFetch

NFetch is an alternative to Neofetch (unfortunately discontinued, rip ☹️) that uses [Nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) icons.

Since Nerdfonts contains several icons for Linux distributions, NFetch makes use of these icons by detecting your distro and using the right icon for you, using the [distro module](https://distro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for Python.

## Usage

> Note: NFetch is (currently) only usable on Linux, since some of the techniques for getting system information is Linux **ONLY**.

To use NFetch, you must download it (obviously).

Easiest way? Just go [here](https://github.com/FormunaGit/NFetch/blob/main/nfetch.py) and hit the Download button.
